	<description>
	Hi there. Quadrate is a game about squares. You are a square. The enemies are squares and the powerups are squares.
	</description>

	<history>
	The idea behind Quadrate was initially conceived by Anton a late night in November. Over the course of a couple of hours the base of the game was already complete. After that many hard working hours turned it in to the polished game it is today.
